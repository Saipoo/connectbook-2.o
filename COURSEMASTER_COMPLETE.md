## Key Algorithms

### Progress Calculation
```javascript
overallProgress = (completedVideos / totalVideos) * 100
videoCompleted = watchedDuration >= (videoDuration * 0.90) // 90% threshold
```

### Quiz Evaluation
```javascript
// Auto-evaluate each answer
answers.forEach(answer => {
  const question = course.quizzes.find(q => q._id === answer.questionId);
  const isCorrect = answer.answer.toLowerCase() === question.correctAnswer.toLowerCase();
  score += isCorrect ? question.marks : 0;
});

percentage = (score / totalMarks) * 100;
passed = percentage >= 60; // 60% pass threshold
```

### Course Completion
```javascript
// Completion requires:
1. All videos watched (90% threshold)
2. Quiz passed (≥60%)

if (allVideosWatched && quizPassed) {
  enrollment.completed = true;
  enrollment.overallProgress = 100;
  enrollment.completionDate = new Date();
}
```

### Certificate ID Generation
```javascript
const timestamp = Date.now().toString(36);
const uuid = uuidv4().split('-')[0];
certificateId = `CERT-${timestamp}-${uuid}`;
// Example: CERT-l4h2k3j1-a7b8c9d0
```
