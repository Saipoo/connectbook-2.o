# FAQ Syntax Error Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Summary
**Error**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'study'` at line 1678 in seedFAQs.js  
**Cause**: Orphaned text after array closing bracket `];`  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
During a previous edit to the `seedFAQs.js` file, duplicate content was accidentally placed after the closing bracket of the `faqData` array. This caused a JavaScript syntax error:

```javascript
  }
];
// ❌ ERROR: This text was outside the array
- Personalized study planning
- Interactive courses and certifications
...
```

### What Happened
The text was supposed to be part of the "What is ConnectBook?" FAQ object but got duplicated and placed after the array closing bracket, making it invalid JavaScript syntax.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Changes Made

**File**: `backend/seedFAQs.js`

**Action**: Removed duplicate orphaned text that appeared after the array closing bracket

**Before** (Lines 1670-1710):
```javascript
    order: 5
  }
];
- Personalized study planning  // ❌ ORPHANED TEXT
- Interactive courses and certifications
...
(lots of duplicate content)
...
  }
];  // ❌ DUPLICATE CLOSING BRACKET

/**
 * Seed FAQs into database
 * @param {boolean} standalone - If true, exits process after completion
 */
 * @param {boolean} standalone - If true, exits process after completion  // ❌ DUPLICATE
 */
export async function seedFAQs(standalone = false) {
```

**After** (Lines 1670-1685):
```javascript
    order: 7  // ✅ Fixed order number
  }
];  // ✅ Clean array closing

/**
 * Seed FAQs into database
 * @param {boolean} standalone - If true, exits process after completion
 */
export async function seedFAQs(standalone = false) {  // ✅ Clean function declaration
```
