## 📊 Dashboard Stats Calculations

### Completion Rate:
```
(Total Completed Students / Total Enrolled Students) × 100
```

### Average Progress:
```
Sum of all student progress percentages / Total Enrolled Students
```

**Example:**
- 10 students enrolled
- 3 completed (100% each)
- 7 in progress (ranging from 20-80%)
- Completion Rate = (3/10) × 100 = 30%
- Average Progress = (100+100+100+80+70+60+50+40+30+20) / 10 = 65%

---

## 🔐 Security

### Authorization:
- All teacher dashboard endpoints require teacher role
- Backend validates teacher owns the course
- Student progress endpoints validate student identity
- JWT tokens required for all API calls

### Data Privacy:
- Teachers only see data for THEIR courses
- Students only see data for THEIR enrollments
- Certificates stored with unique IDs

---

## 🚀 Navigation Paths

### Teacher Access Dashboard:
**Option 1:** Teacher Dashboard → "Course Dashboard" card → Dashboard
**Option 2:** Course Creator → "View Dashboard" button → Dashboard

### Student Access Course:
CourseMaster → Find enrolled course → "Continue Learning" → Course Detail View

---

## 📈 What Changed in Code

### Before (Bug):
```javascript
// CourseMaster.jsx - handleViewCourse()
if (response.data.course.enrollmentId) {  // ❌ Field doesn't exist
  const enrollmentResponse = await axios.get(...)
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Always fetch enrollment data
const enrollmentResponse = await axios.get(
  `http://localhost:5000/api/courses/progress/${userId}`,
  { headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` } }
);

const courseEnrollment = enrollmentResponse.data.enrollments.find(
  e => e.courseId._id === courseId || e.courseId === courseId
);
```
