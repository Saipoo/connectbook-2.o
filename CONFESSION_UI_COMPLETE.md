## 📊 Technical Implementation

### State Management:
- Local state with React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- JWT authentication via localStorage
- Role-based API filtering on backend

### API Architecture:
- All endpoints require JWT token in headers
- Role-based authorization middleware
- Encryption/decryption handled on backend
- AI analysis performed server-side

### Data Flow:
```
User Login → JWT Token → Dashboard → Confession Page
                                            ↓
                                    API Call (with token)
                                            ↓
                                Backend Role Check → Filter Data
                                            ↓
                                    Return Confessions → Render UI
