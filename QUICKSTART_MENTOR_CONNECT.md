## Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Starting

# In backend/.env, verify:
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Frontend Not Connecting to Backend
```bash
# In frontend, create .env file:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Socket.io Connection Error
- Ensure backend is running first
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify no firewall blocking port 5000

### File Upload Not Working
- Check `backend/uploads/chat_files/` folder exists
- Verify file size is under 10MB
- Check file type is supported

### Video Meeting Black Screen
- Allow browser camera/microphone permissions
- Use HTTPS in production (WebRTC requirement)
- Check browser console for WebRTC errors
