# Quick Fix Summary: Gemini API Transcription

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Wrong Gemini Model** → Changed from `gemini-2.5-flash` to `gemini-1.5-flash`
2. **Missing API Key Check** → Added validation for GEMINI_API_KEY
3. **Poor Error Logging** → Added comprehensive logging at every step
4. **No File Validation** → Added file existence check before reading
5. **No Content Validation** → Added checks for empty transcriptions/summaries

## 🎯 What Happens Now

When teacher records a meeting:
1. ✅ Video uploads to `/uploads/lectures/`
2. ✅ AI reads the actual video file
3. ✅ Gemini API transcribes what was ACTUALLY said
4. ✅ Generates summary from REAL transcription
5. ✅ Students see REAL lecture content (not fake)

## 🧪 Test It Now

**Teacher:**
1. Create lecture
2. Start meeting
3. Record for 10 seconds
4. Say: "Hello students! Today we learn about machine learning..."
5. End meeting

**Watch Console:**
```bash
✅ File exists
✅ Transcription complete!
   - First 200 chars: Hello students! Today we learn about...
✅ Summary generated
```

**Student:**
1. Go to Lecture Notes
2. See "ML Test" lecture
3. View Notes
4. Summary should contain "machine learning" (what you said!)
