## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Parent Multi-Child:** Currently 1 student per parent
   - **Solution:** Change `studentUSN` to array in future

2. **Real-time Updates:** Dashboard data fetched on page load only
   - **Solution:** Add Socket.io or polling in future

3. **Certificate URLs:** Assumes certificates have downloadable URLs
   - **Solution:** Ensure certificate generation includes URL field

4. **GradeMaster Certificates:** Endpoint may not exist yet
   - **Status:** Gracefully handles 404, shows only CourseMaster certs

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Immediate:**
1. ✅ Test all dashboards with different user roles
2. ✅ Link parents to students via `studentUSN`
