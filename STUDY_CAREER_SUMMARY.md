```javascript
import studyPlannerRoutes from './routes/studyPlannerRoutes.js';
import careerAdvisorRoutes from './routes/careerAdvisorRoutes.js';

app.use('/api/study-planner', studyPlannerRoutes);
app.use('/api/career', careerAdvisorRoutes);
```

### Step 3: Test Backend

Use Postman/Thunder Client to test:
- Create study plan
- Add tasks
