## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

### Issue: CastError on `/my-enrollments` and `/my-participations`
**Root Cause:** Route order in Express - `/:id` was matched before specific routes

**Solution:** Moved parameterized `/:id` routes to the END of:
- `backend/routes/internshipRoutes.js`
- `backend/routes/hackathonRoutes.js`

**Result:** ✅ All routes now work correctly

See `BUGFIX_ROUTE_ORDERING_AND_DASHBOARDS_COMPLETE.md` for detailed fix documentation.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Real-time Chat**: Uses polling, Socket.io integration pending
2. **Certificate PDFs**: Basic format, can be enhanced with custom designs
3. **File Storage**: Local storage, consider cloud (S3, Cloudinary) for production
4. **Batch Operations**: Teachers can only search one student at a time

**Note:** All core functionality is complete and production-ready!
