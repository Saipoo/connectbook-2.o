# 🎯 Quick Summary: Fixes & Enhancements Applied

## 🐛 Bug Fixed
**Problem:** CastError when accessing `/api/internships/my-enrollments` and `/api/hackathons/my-participations`

**Cause:** Express Router matched generic `/:id` route before specific routes

**Solution:** Moved `/:id` routes to the END of both route files

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `backend/routes/internshipRoutes.js`
- ✅ `backend/routes/hackathonRoutes.js`

**Result:** ✅ All routes now work perfectly!
