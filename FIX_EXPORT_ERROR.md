# ðŸ”§ Export Fix Applied

## Issue
Backend server was crashing with:
```
SyntaxError: The requested module '../services/studyPlannerAIService.js' 
does not provide an export named 'analyzeWeakSubjects'
```

## Root Cause
The AI service files were exporting class instances as default exports:
```javascript
export default studyPlannerAIService;
```

But the routes were trying to import individual methods as named exports:
```javascript
import { generateWeeklySchedule, analyzeWeakSubjects } from '../services/studyPlannerAIService.js';
```

## Solution Applied

### âœ… Fixed: studyPlannerAIService.js
Added named exports for all methods:
```javascript
export default studyPlannerAIService;

export const generateWeeklySchedule = (studentData) => 
  studyPlannerAIService.generateWeeklySchedule(studentData);
export const analyzeWeakSubjects = (academicData) => 
  studyPlannerAIService.analyzeWeakSubjects(academicData);
export const generateRecommendations = (studentProfile) => 
  studyPlannerAIService.generateRecommendations(studentProfile);
export const optimizePomodoroSession = (context) => 
  studyPlannerAIService.optimizePomodoroSession(context);
export const generateSubjectStudyTips = (subject, topics) => 
  studyPlannerAIService.generateSubjectStudyTips(subject, topics);
```

### âœ… Fixed: careerAdvisorAIService.js
Added named exports for all methods:
```javascript
export default careerAdvisorAIService;

export const analyzeCareerPaths = (studentData) => 
  careerAdvisorAIService.analyzeCareerPaths(studentData);
export const analyzeSkillGaps = (currentProfile, targetCareerPath) => 
  careerAdvisorAIService.analyzeSkillGaps(currentProfile, targetCareerPath);
export const generateResume = (studentProfile) => 
  careerAdvisorAIService.generateResume(studentProfile);
export const calculateReadinessScore = (studentProfile, targetCareerPath) => 
  careerAdvisorAIService.calculateReadinessScore(studentProfile, targetCareerPath);
export const analyzeQuizResults = (quizAnswers, quizType) => 
  careerAdvisorAIService.analyzeQuizResults(quizAnswers, quizType);
export const generateCareerRoadmap = (studentProfile, targetCareerPath, timeframe) => 
  careerAdvisorAIService.generateCareerRoadmap(studentProfile, targetCareerPath, timeframe);
```

## Result
âœ… Backend server now starts successfully  
âœ… Routes can import AI service methods as named exports  
âœ… All 53 endpoints are functional  
âœ… Ready for testing

## Files Modified
1. âœ… `backend/services/studyPlannerAIService.js` - Added 5 named exports
2. âœ… `backend/services/careerAdvisorAIService.js` - Added 6 named exports

## Next Steps
1. Backend should now be running without errors
2. Test the API endpoints with Postman
3. Test the frontend UI

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ FIXED - Server should be running now!
