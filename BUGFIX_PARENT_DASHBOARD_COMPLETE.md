# ✅ Fixed Parent Dashboard Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ 500 Error on Student Enrollments Endpoint
### 2. ✅ 500 Error on Student Certificates Endpoint  
### 3. ✅ 404 Error on Parent Profile Endpoint
### 4. ✅ Certificates Display with View Button
### 5. ✅ Grade Reports Already Working

---

## Root Causes

### Issue 1 & 2: USN vs ObjectId Mismatch

**Problem**: 
- Frontend was sending USN (`1VE22IS068`) in URL
- Backend endpoints expected MongoDB ObjectId
- Endpoints crashed trying to find records by USN when looking for ObjectId

**Example**:
```javascript
// Frontend calling:
/api/courses/student/1VE22IS068/enrollments

// Backend looking for:
CourseEnrollment.find({ studentId: "1VE22IS068" })  // ❌ Wrong field!
```

### Issue 3: Missing Endpoint

**Problem**: 
- GradeViewer was calling `/api/parents/profile`
- This endpoint didn't exist in backend
- Caused 404 error

### Issue 4: Wrong Field Names

**Problem**:
- Frontend used `cert.issuedDate` and `cert.certificateUrl`
- Backend model has `cert.issueDate` and `cert.pdfUrl`
- Certificates weren't displaying properly

---

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Student Enrollments Endpoint

**File**: `backend/routes/courseRoutes.js` (Line ~481)

**Added USN Support**:
```javascript
router.get('/student/:studentId/enrollments', protect, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { studentId } = req.params;
    
    // ✅ Check if studentId is USN or ObjectId
    let enrollments;
    if (studentId.match(/^[0-9A-Z]{10}$/)) {
      // It's a USN - search by studentUSN field
      enrollments = await CourseEnrollment.find({ 
        studentUSN: studentId.toUpperCase() 
      })
        .populate('courseId')
        .sort({ enrolledAt: -1 });
    } else {
      // It's an ObjectId - search by studentId field
      enrollments = await CourseEnrollment.find({ studentId })
        .populate('courseId')
        .sort({ enrolledAt: -1 });
    }
    
    // ✅ Return consistent format with progress
    const enrollmentsWithProgress = validEnrollments.map(enrollment => ({
      _id: enrollment._id,
      course: enrollment.courseId,
      courseName: enrollment.courseName,
      enrolledAt: enrollment.enrolledAt,
      lastAccessedAt: enrollment.lastAccessedAt,
      completedAt: enrollment.completedAt,
      progress: enrollment.overallProgress || 0
    }));
    
    // ✅ Changed: enrollments → data (consistent)
    res.json({
      success: true,
      data: enrollmentsWithProgress  // Was: enrollments: ...
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // error handling...
  }
});
```

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added USN pattern detection (`/^[0-9A-Z]{10}$/`)
- ✅ Query by `studentUSN` field when USN detected
- ✅ Query by `studentId` field when ObjectId detected
- ✅ Changed response from `enrollments:` to `data:` (consistent format)
- ✅ Added progress mapping

---

### 2. Fixed Student Certificates Endpoint

**File**: `backend/routes/courseRoutes.js` (Line ~510)

**Added USN Support**:
```javascript
router.get('/student/:studentId/certificates', protect, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { studentId } = req.params;
    
    // ✅ Check if studentId is USN or ObjectId
    let certificates;
    if (studentId.match(/^[0-9A-Z]{10}$/)) {
      // It's a USN - search by studentUSN field
      certificates = await Certificate.find({ 
        studentUSN: studentId.toUpperCase() 
      })
        .populate('courseId')
        .sort({ issueDate: -1 });  // ✅ Fixed: was issuedAt
    } else {
      // It's an ObjectId - search by studentId field
      certificates = await Certificate.find({ studentId })
        .populate('courseId')
        .sort({ issueDate: -1 });  // ✅ Fixed: was issuedAt
    }
    
    const validCertificates = certificates.filter(c => c.courseId);
    
    // ✅ Changed: certificates → data (consistent)
    res.json({
      success: true,
      data: validCertificates  // Was: certificates: ...
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // error handling...
  }
});
```

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added USN pattern detection
- ✅ Query by `studentUSN` field when USN detected
- ✅ Query by `studentId` field when ObjectId detected
- ✅ Fixed sort field: `issuedAt` → `issueDate` (correct field name)
- ✅ Changed response from `certificates:` to `data:` (consistent format)

### 3. Added Parent Profile Endpoint

**File**: `backend/routes/parentRoutes.js` (Line ~12, added at top)

**New Endpoint**:
```javascript
/**
 * @route   GET /api/parents/profile
 * @desc    Get parent profile with linked student USN
 * @access  Private (Parent)
 */
router.get('/profile', protect, authorize('parent'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const parent = await Parent.findById(req.user._id);
    
    if (!parent) {
      return res.status(404).json({
        success: false,
        message: 'Parent not found'
      });
    }

    res.json({
      success: true,
      _id: parent._id,
      name: parent.name,
      email: parent.email,
      phone: parent.phone,
      linkedStudentUSN: parent.linkedStudentUSN  // ✅ Key field!
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching parent profile:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Error fetching parent profile'
    });
  }
});
```

**Result**: GradeViewer can now fetch parent's linked student USN

### 4. Fixed Certificate Field Names in Frontend

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/dashboards/ParentDashboard.jsx` (Line ~550)

**Fixed Fields**:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong field names):
<span>Issued: {new Date(cert.issuedDate).toLocaleDateString()}</span>
{cert.certificateUrl && (
  <a href={`http://localhost:5000${cert.certificateUrl}`}>

// AFTER (Correct field names with fallbacks):
<span>Issued: {new Date(cert.issueDate || cert.issuedDate || cert.completionDate).toLocaleDateString()}</span>
{(cert.pdfUrl || cert.certificateUrl) && (
  <a href={`http://localhost:5000${cert.pdfUrl || cert.certificateUrl}`}>
```

**Changes**:
- ✅ `cert.issuedDate` → `cert.issueDate` (with fallbacks)
- ✅ `cert.certificateUrl` → `cert.pdfUrl` (with fallback)
- ✅ View Certificate button now works
