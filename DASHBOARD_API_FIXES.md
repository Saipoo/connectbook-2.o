# Dashboard API Endpoint Fixes

## Issue
After implementing the new dashboards, the following errors occurred:
- 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/courses/my-certificates`
- 500 Internal Server Error on `/api/courses/my-enrollments`
- Student, Teacher, and Parent dashboards showing empty data
- Certificate page not loading

## Root Cause
The new dashboard components were calling API endpoints that didn't exist in the backend:
1. `/api/courses/my-enrollments` - Student's enrolled courses
2. `/api/courses/my-certificates` - Student's certificates  
3. `/api/courses/student/:studentId/enrollments` - For parent dashboard
4. `/api/courses/student/:studentId/certificates` - For parent dashboard
5. `/api/grades/student/:studentId/results` - Student grades for parents

## Solution

### Added Endpoints to `backend/routes/courseRoutes.js`

#### 1. Student's Enrolled Courses
```javascript
// GET: Student's enrolled courses
router.get('/my-enrollments', protect, authorize('student'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const studentId = req.user._id;
    
    const enrollments = await CourseEnrollment.find({ studentId })
      .populate('courseId')
      .sort({ enrolledAt: -1 });
    
    const validEnrollments = enrollments.filter(e => e.courseId);
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      enrollments: validEnrollments
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching enrollments:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Error fetching enrollments',
      error: error.message
    });
  }
});
```

#### 2. Student's Certificates
```javascript
// GET: Student's certificates
router.get('/my-certificates', protect, authorize('student'), async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const studentId = req.user._id;
    
    const certificates = await Certificate.find({ studentId })
      .populate('courseId')
      .sort({ issuedAt: -1 });
    
    const validCertificates = certificates.filter(c => c.courseId);
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      certificates: validCertificates
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching certificates:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Error fetching certificates',
      error: error.message
    });
  }
});
```

#### 3. Student Enrollments by ID (Parent/Teacher Access)
```javascript
// GET: Student's enrollments by student ID (for parents/teachers)
router.get('/student/:studentId/enrollments', protect, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { studentId } = req.params;
    
    const enrollments = await CourseEnrollment.find({ studentId })
      .populate('courseId')
      .sort({ enrolledAt: -1 });
    
    const validEnrollments = enrollments.filter(e => e.courseId);
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      enrollments: validEnrollments
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching student enrollments:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Error fetching student enrollments',
      error: error.message
    });
  }
});
```

#### 4. Student Certificates by ID (Parent/Teacher Access)
```javascript
// GET: Student's certificates by student ID (for parents/teachers)
router.get('/student/:studentId/certificates', protect, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { studentId } = req.params;
    
    const certificates = await Certificate.find({ studentId })
      .populate('courseId')
      .sort({ issuedAt: -1 });
    
    const validCertificates = certificates.filter(c => c.courseId);
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      certificates: validCertificates
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching student certificates:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Error fetching student certificates',
      error: error.message
    });
  }
});
```

### Added Endpoint to `backend/routes/gradeRoutes.js`

#### 5. Student Grades by ID (Parent/Teacher Access)
```javascript
// GET: Student's grades by student ID (for parents/teachers)
router.get('/student/:studentId/results', protect, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { studentId } = req.params;
    
    const grades = await Grade.find({ studentId, verified: true })
      .sort({ gradedDate: -1 })
      .populate('teacherId', 'name email');
    
    res.json({
      success: true,
      grades: grades
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching student grades:', error);
    res.status(500).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Error fetching student grades',
      error: error.message
    });
  }
});
```

## Existing Endpoints (Already Working)

These endpoints were already present and working correctly:

### Student Dashboard
- ✅ `/api/attendance/my-attendance` - Student's attendance records
- ✅ `/api/courses/teacher/my-courses` - Teacher's courses (for teacher dashboard)
- ✅ `/api/grades/teacher/submissions` - Teacher's submissions (for teacher dashboard)

### Parent Dashboard  
- ✅ `/api/parents/my-student` - Linked student data
- ✅ `/api/attendance/student/:usn` - Student attendance by USN

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
node server.js
```

### 2. Test Student Dashboard
- Login as student
- Dashboard should show:
  - ✅ Attendance percentage
  - ✅ Total enrolled courses
  - ✅ Courses in progress
  - ✅ Earned certificates
  - ✅ Recent activities
  - ✅ Quick action buttons

### 3. Test Teacher Dashboard
- Login as teacher
- Dashboard should show:
  - ✅ Courses created
  - ✅ Total enrollments
  - ✅ Pending reviews (with badge)
  - ✅ Recent submissions
  - ✅ Top courses

### 4. Test Parent Dashboard
- Login as parent with linked student
- Dashboard should show:
  - ✅ Student info banner
  - ✅ Attendance stats
  - ✅ Completed courses
  - ✅ Average grade
  - ✅ Recent grades list
  - ✅ Certificates showcase

### 5. Test Certificates Page
- Navigate to `/dashboard/student/certificates`
- Should display:
  - ✅ Search bar
  - ✅ Filter buttons (All/CourseMaster/GradeMaster)
  - ✅ Statistics cards
  - ✅ Certificate grid
  - ✅ View/Download buttons

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `backend/routes/courseRoutes.js` - Added 4 new endpoints
2. ✅ `backend/routes/gradeRoutes.js` - Added 1 new endpoint
3. ✅ `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Updated routing to use new dashboards
