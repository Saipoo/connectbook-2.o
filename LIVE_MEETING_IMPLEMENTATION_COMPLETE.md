## 🐛 Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
1. **Single-sided WebRTC**: Currently only teacher streams to students (one-way video)
2. **No persistent video URLs**: Recording saved after meeting ends, not streamed live
3. **No breakout rooms**: All students in main room
4. **No whiteboard**: Screen share only
5. **Basic chat**: No file sharing in chat

### Future Enhancements (Ready to Implement):
- [ ] **Peer-to-peer video** using simple-peer for multi-way video
- [ ] **Live streaming** using RTMP/HLS for scalability
- [ ] **Virtual backgrounds** using TensorFlow.js
- [ ] **Breakout rooms** for group activities
- [ ] **Interactive whiteboard** with drawing tools
- [ ] **Polls and quizzes** during lecture
- [ ] **Automatic attendance** tracking
- [ ] **Closed captions** in real-time
- [ ] **File sharing** in chat
- [ ] **Meeting recordings library** for replay

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### If camera/mic doesn't work:
1. Check browser permissions (Settings → Privacy)
2. Ensure HTTPS or localhost (WebRTC requirement)
3. Try different browser (Chrome/Edge recommended)
4. Check if other apps are using camera/mic

### If screen share fails:
1. Browser must support getDisplayMedia API
2. Chrome/Edge work best
3. Firefox requires additional permissions
4. Safari has limited support

### If recording doesn't upload:
1. Check file size (should be < 500MB)
2. Verify stable internet connection
3. Look at browser console for errors
4. Check server logs for upload issues

### If students can't join:
1. Verify student is enrolled in lecture
2. Check meeting is marked as "live"
3. Ensure stable internet connection
4. Try refreshing the page
