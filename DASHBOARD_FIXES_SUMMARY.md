# ✅ DASHBOARD FIXES COMPLETE

## What Was Fixed

### 🔴 Problem
- New dashboards showed empty data
- 500 errors on certificate and enrollment endpoints
- APIs were missing for the new dashboard components

### ✅ Solution
Added 5 missing API endpoints:

1. **`GET /api/courses/my-enrollments`** - Student's courses
2. **`GET /api/courses/my-certificates`** - Student's certificates  
3. **`GET /api/courses/student/:studentId/enrollments`** - For parents
4. **`GET /api/courses/student/:studentId/certificates`** - For parents
5. **`GET /api/grades/student/:studentId/results`** - Student grades

## How to Test

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# 1. Restart backend (if not running)
cd "c:\Users\Dell\Desktop\crap cb major\backend"
node server.js

# 2. Open frontend (in new terminal)

npm run dev
```

### Test Flow

3. **Teacher Dashboard** → Shows created courses, submissions, enrollments ✅
4. **Parent Dashboard** → Shows linked student's data ✅
