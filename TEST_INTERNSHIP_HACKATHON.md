# 🔧 Quick Test & Fix Guide

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed API Response Handling
**Files Fixed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/student/internship/InternshipSimulator.jsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/student/hackathon/HackathonChallenges.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Changed `data.internships` → `data.data || []`
- Changed `data.enrollments` → `data.data || []`
- Changed `data.hackathons` → `data.data || []`
- Changed `data.participations` → `data.data || []`
- Changed `data.enrollment` → `data.data`
- Added fallback empty arrays `|| []` to prevent crashes
- Added `setInternships([])` and `setHackathons([])` in catch blocks

**Why:** The backend returns `{ success: true, data: [...] }` but frontend was looking for `data.internships` and `data.enrollments`.

```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
```
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

### Step 3: Test Internship Simulator
```
1. Login as student
2. Click "Internship Simulator" in sidebar
3. Should see list of internships
4. Click "My Enrollments" tab
5. Should work without errors
```

### Step 4: Test Hackathon Simulator

## 🐛 If Still Getting Errors

### Check Browser Console (F12)
Look for:
- ❌ 404 errors → Backend not running
- ❌ 401 errors → Token expired, re-login
- ❌ 500 errors → Check backend terminal for errors
- ❌ CORS errors → Backend needs restart

### Check Backend Terminal
Look for:
- ✅ "GET /api/internships 200" → Working
- ✅ "GET /api/internships/my-enrollments 200" → Working
- ❌ "CastError" → Routes still in wrong order (restart needed)

### Nuclear Option: Full Restart
```bash
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C in terminal)
cd backend
npm start

# Stop frontend (Ctrl+C)
cd frontend  
npm run dev

# Clear browser cache and try again
```
