- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue: Lectures show "Processing" forever
**Check:**
- Server console for AI processing errors
- Gemini API key is set in .env
- No error messages in server terminal
- Try creating a shorter recording (10 seconds)

### Issue: AI notes are empty
**Check:**
- Wait longer (AI processing can take 1-5 minutes)
- Check server console for "‚úÖ Lecture [id] processed and published successfully"
- Verify Gemini API is working
- Check for quota limits on Gemini API

### Issue: Can't join live meeting
**Check:**
- Is teacher still in the meeting?
- Is the meeting status "live"?
- Refresh student page
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: No live meetings showing
**Check:**
- Teacher must click "Start Live Meeting" (not just create)
- Meeting status must be "live"
- Student page auto-refreshes every 30 seconds, or manually refresh
- Check "Live Now" tab is selected
