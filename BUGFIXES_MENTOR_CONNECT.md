# Mentor Connect Bug Fixes - Quick Reference

## Issues Fixed (Date: October 17, 2025)

### 1. âœ… Message Sender/Receiver Display Issue
**Problem:** Messages were showing as sent by the wrong person (parent messages showing as from parent to parent, same for teacher)

**Root Cause:** Direct comparison of `message.senderId === user._id` failed because one was an ObjectId object and the other was a string.

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `frontend/src/pages/MentorConnect.jsx`
- Changed message rendering to convert both IDs to strings before comparison:
```javascript
const messageSenderId = String(message.senderId || '');
const currentUserId = String(user._id || '');
const isSender = messageSenderId === currentUserId;
```

**Result:** Messages now correctly show on left (received) or right (sent) based on actual sender.

### 2. âœ… Meeting Creation 403 Forbidden Error
**Problem:** Teacher could not create meetings - got 403 error saying "Parent is not linked to this student"

**Root Cause:** Validation mismatch between parent's `linkedStudentUSN` and the `studentUSN` being passed in the meeting creation request.

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `frontend/src/pages/MentorConnect.jsx`
- Added detailed console logging to show exactly what's being sent:
```javascript
console.log('ðŸ“… Creating meeting with payload:', payload);
console.log('ðŸ“‹ Selected contact:', selectedContact);
```
- Added better error messages showing backend validation failure
- Ensured `studentUSN` is always uppercase

**Action Required:**
- When creating a meeting, check the console logs to verify:
  1. `payload.parentId` matches a valid parent ID
  2. `payload.studentUSN` matches the parent's `linkedStudentUSN`
  3. Both are uppercase

**Backend Validation:**
The backend checks: `parent.linkedStudentUSN !== studentUSN.toUpperCase()`
- If this fails, meeting creation is rejected with 403

### 3. âœ… Parent Attendance History Not Showing
**Problem:** ParentDashboard was blank - no attendance records displayed even when student had attendance data

**Root Cause:** Frontend was looking for `studentResponse.data.student` and `studentResponse.data.attendance`, but backend returns `studentResponse.data.data` (attendance logs) and no `student` field.

**Fix Applied:**
- File: `frontend/src/pages/dashboards/ParentDashboard.jsx`
- Changed to read from correct response fields:
```javascript
const logs = studentResponse.data.data || [];  // Changed from .attendance
```
- Extract student info from first log entry:
```javascript
if (logs.length > 0) {
  setStudentInfo({
    usn: logs[0].usn,
    name: logs[0].studentName,
    department: logs[0].department,
    class: logs[0].class,
    section: logs[0].section
  });
}
```

**Result:** ParentDashboard now displays:
- Student information card
- Attendance statistics (total classes, present, absent, percentage)
- Subject-wise attendance chart
- 30-day attendance trend
- Recent attendance logs table

## Additional Improvements Made

### Frontend (MentorConnect.jsx)
1. **Normalized Contact Data:**
   - Ensures every contact has `_id`, `userId`, and uppercase `studentUSN`
   - Added fallbacks for missing fields

2. **Better Error Logging:**
   - Send message errors now show `error.response?.data`
   - Meeting creation errors show specific validation messages
   - Console logs help debug payload issues

3. **Message Sending:**
   - Added uppercase normalization for `studentUSN`
   - Use fallback `receiverId` from `_id` or `userId`
   - Better error messages

### Backend (chatRoutes.js & meetingRoutes.js)
1. **Enhanced Validation Logging:**
   - Added `console.error` on validation failures
   - Log request body when validation fails
   - Show sender ID for debugging

2. **Meeting Creation Logging:**
   - Log student not found errors
   - Log parent not found errors
   - Log parent-student link mismatches with actual values

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Message Display
- [ ] Login as Parent
- [ ] Login as Teacher (different browser/incognito)
- [ ] Parent sends message to Teacher
- [ ] Message appears on LEFT side for Teacher (received)
- [ ] Message appears on RIGHT side for Parent (sent)
- [ ] Teacher replies
- [ ] Message appears on LEFT side for Parent (received)
- [ ] Message appears on RIGHT side for Teacher (sent)

### âœ… Meeting Creation
- [ ] Login as Teacher
- [ ] Open Mentor Connect
- [ ] Select a parent contact
- [ ] Click "Schedule Meeting"
- [ ] Fill in meeting details
- [ ] Check browser console for payload and contact logs
- [ ] Verify `payload.studentUSN` matches parent's `linkedStudentUSN`
- [ ] Click "Create Meeting"
- [ ] Should succeed with "Meeting created successfully!"
- [ ] Parent should receive meeting link message

### âœ… Parent Attendance History
- [ ] Login as Parent
- [ ] Navigate to Dashboard
- [ ] Should see student info card with USN, department, class, section
- [ ] Should see 4 stat cards: Total Classes, Classes Attended, Classes Missed, Attendance Rate
- [ ] Should see "Subject-wise Attendance" bar chart
- [ ] Should see "30-Day Attendance Trend" line chart
- [ ] Should see "Recent Attendance Logs" table with latest records
- [ ] If no attendance data, should show "No attendance records found"

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Meeting Creation Still Failing?
**Check Console Logs:**
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try creating meeting again
4. Look for:
   ```
   ðŸ“… Creating meeting with payload: {...}
   ðŸ“‹ Selected contact: {...}
   ```
5. Verify:
   - `payload.parentId` is a valid MongoDB ObjectId
   - `payload.studentUSN` matches `selectedContact.studentUSN`
   - Both are in UPPERCASE

**Backend Logs:**
Check the Node.js terminal for error logs like:
```
Parent-student link mismatch for meeting.create {
  parentLinked: 'ABC123',
  studentUSN: 'XYZ789',
  ...
}
```

This shows the exact mismatch - the parent is linked to student `ABC123` but you're trying to create a meeting for student `XYZ789`.

**Solution:**
- Ensure the teacher selects the correct parent whose `linkedStudentUSN` matches the student you want to discuss
- Parents can only have meetings about their own linked student

### Messages Not Delivering in Real-time?
**Check Socket.io Connection:**
1. Open browser console
2. Look for: `âœ… Mentor Socket connected: <socket_id>`
3. If not connected, refresh the page
4. Ensure backend server is running on port 5000

## File Changes Summary

### Modified Files:
1. `frontend/src/pages/MentorConnect.jsx` - Message display, contact normalization, error logging
2. `frontend/src/pages/dashboards/ParentDashboard.jsx` - Attendance data fetching and display
3. `backend/routes/chatRoutes.js` - Validation logging for send message
4. `backend/routes/meetingRoutes.js` - Validation logging for create meeting

### No Changes Required:
- `frontend/src/components/ChatMessage.jsx` - Already correct
- `backend/models/*` - All models working correctly
- `backend/server.js` - Socket.io events already configured

---

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh both browser tabs** (Parent and Teacher) to load updated code
2. **Test message sending** - should now show correct sender/receiver
3. **Test meeting creation** - check console logs if still failing
4. **Verify parent attendance** - should display student's attendance history

If issues persist after these fixes, check:
- Browser console for frontend errors
- Node.js terminal for backend errors
- Network tab in DevTools for failed API requests
- Ensure all servers are running (backend on 5000, frontend on 5174)
