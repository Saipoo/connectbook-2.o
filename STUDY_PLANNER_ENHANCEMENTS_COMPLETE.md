# Study Planner Enhancements - Complete âœ…

## Date: October 19, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Task Completion Not Reflecting in Dashboard âœ…
**Problem:** When marking a task as completed, the dashboard statistics weren't updating  
**Root Cause:** Frontend wasn't waiting for the dashboard refresh
**Solution:**
- Added await to fetchDashboard() call
- Added success/error alerts for user feedback
- Force refresh after task completion

```javascript
// Before
fetchDashboard();

// After
if (response.data.success) {
  await fetchDashboard();
  alert('âœ… Task marked as completed!');
}
```

### 2. AI Schedule Generation Without User Input âœ…
**Problem:** Generate Schedule button directly called API without asking for preferences  
**Root Cause:** No wizard/form to collect user preferences
**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive Schedule Generation Wizard modal
- Collects 7 key parameters from user
- Passes preferences to backend for AI processing
