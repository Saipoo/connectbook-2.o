# 🐛 BUGFIX: Route Ordering Fixed + Teacher/Parent Dashboards Complete

## ✅ Bug Fixed: CastError in Internship & Hackathon Routes

### Problem
```
Error: CastError: Cast to ObjectId failed for value "my-enrollments" (type string) at path "_id"
Error: CastError: Cast to ObjectId failed for value "my-participations" (type string) at path "_id"
```

**Root Cause:**
Express Router was matching routes in order. The generic `/:id` route was placed BEFORE specific routes like `/my-enrollments` and `/my-participations`, causing Express to treat "my-enrollments" as an ID parameter and try to cast it to ObjectId.

### Solution
**Moved parameterized routes to the END of the router definitions.**

#### Files Fixed:

**1. `backend/routes/internshipRoutes.js`**
- ✅ Moved `router.get('/:id', ...)` from line 43 to BEFORE `export default router`
- ✅ Now all specific routes are matched first:
  - `/` (list all)
  - `/enroll` (enroll)
  - `/my-enrollments` ✓ (student's enrollments)
  - `/enrollment/:enrollmentId/tasks` (get tasks)
  - `/task/submit` (submit task)
  - `/task/ai-help` (AI help)
  - `/task/:taskId/evaluation` (view evaluation)
  - `/certificate` (generate cert)
  - `/certificates` (list certs)
  - `/student/:usn` (parent/teacher view)
  - **`/:id` (single internship) ← NOW AT THE END**

**2. `backend/routes/hackathonRoutes.js`**
- ✅ Moved `router.get('/:id', ...)` from line 43 to BEFORE `export default router`
- ✅ Now all specific routes are matched first:
  - `/` (list all)
  - `/join` (join hackathon)
  - `/team/invite` (invite members)
  - `/:id/my-team` (get team)
  - `/team/chat` (send message)
  - `/team/:id/chat` (get chat)
  - `/submit` (submit project)
  - `/ai-help` (AI code help)
  - `/:id/leaderboard` (rankings)
  - `/my-participations` ✓ (student's participations)
  - `/student/:usn` (parent/teacher view)
  - **`/:id` (single hackathon) ← NOW AT THE END**

### Result
✅ `/api/internships/my-enrollments` now works correctly
✅ `/api/hackathons/my-participations` now works correctly
✅ No more CastError
✅ All specific routes match before the generic `:id` route
