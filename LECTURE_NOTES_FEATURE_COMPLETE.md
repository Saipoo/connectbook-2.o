   app.use('/api/lectures', lectureRoutes);
   ```

2. **Create Upload Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir backend\uploads\lectures
   ```

3. **Add Frontend Routes**
   ```javascript
   // In frontend/src/App.jsx
   import TeacherLectures from './pages/teacher/TeacherLectures';
   import StudentLectures from './pages/student/StudentLectures';
   
   <Route path="/teacher/lectures" element={<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="teacher"><TeacherLectures /></ProtectedRoute>} />
   <Route path="/student/lectures" element={<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="student"><StudentLectures /></ProtectedRoute>} />
   ```

4. **Add to Sidebar Navigation**
   ```javascript
   // Teacher Sidebar
   { name: 'Lecture Notes', icon: Video, path: '/teacher/lectures' }
   
   // Student Sidebar
   { name: 'Lecture Notes', icon: BookOpen, path: '/student/lectures' }
   ```

5. **Test!**
   - Create lecture as teacher
   - Upload video
   - Wait for processing
   - Publish

- **Generates** flashcards for spaced repetition
- **Organizes** by importance and frequency
- **Provides** statistics on coverage

### Smart Analytics:
Tracks not just views, but:
