# âœ… All Fixes Complete

## Fixed Issues

### 1. âœ… GradeMaster API Routes (Student Side)
**Problem**: All grade API calls were using `/api/grade/*` but backend has `/api/grades/*`

**Fixed Files**:
- `frontend/src/pages/student/GradeMaster.jsx`

**Changes**:
```javascript
// OLD (404 errors):
/api/grade/student/submissions
/api/grade/student/results
/api/grade/upload-answer

// NEW (Working):
/api/grades/student/submissions
/api/grades/student/results
/api/grades/upload-answer
```

**Result**: âœ… Students can now submit answer scripts without 404 errors

---

### 2. âœ… GradeEvaluator API Routes (Teacher Side)
**Problem**: Teacher grade evaluation using wrong API paths

**Fixed Files**:
- `frontend/src/pages/teacher/GradeEvaluator.jsx`

**Changes**:
```javascript
// OLD (404 errors):
/api/grade/teacher/submissions
/api/grade/upload-teacher-docs
/api/grade/evaluate/:id
/api/grade/verify/:id

// NEW (Working):
/api/grades/teacher/submissions
/api/grades/upload-teacher-docs
/api/grades/evaluate/:id
/api/grades/verify/:id
```

**Result**: âœ… Teachers can now fetch submissions and evaluate answer scripts

---

### 3. âœ… Parent GradeViewer API Routes
**Problem**: Calling `/api/auth/parent` (doesn't exist) instead of `/api/parents/profile`

**Fixed Files**:
- `frontend/src/pages/parent/GradeViewer.jsx`

**Changes**:
```javascript
// OLD (404 error):
await api.get('/auth/parent');
await api.get(`/grade/parent/results/${usn}`);

// NEW (Working):
await api.get('/parents/profile');
await api.get(`/grades/parent/results/${usn}`);
```

**Result**: âœ… Parents can now view their child's grade reports

---

### 4. âœ… Added Course Enrollment to Parent Dashboard
**Problem**: Parents couldn't see what courses their child is enrolled in

**Fixed Files**:
- `frontend/src/pages/dashboards/ParentDashboard.jsx`

**Added**:
- New state: `enrolledCourses`
- Fetch function for `/api/courses/student/:usn/enrollments`
- New UI section showing:
  - Course name
  - Progress bar with percentage
  - Enrollment date
  - Last accessed date
  - Completion status

**Result**: âœ… Parents can now see all courses their child is taking with progress

---

### 5. âœ… Fixed Course Enrollment Flow
**Problem**: After enrolling in a course, "Continue Learning" section wasn't appearing

**Fixed Files**:
- `frontend/src/pages/student/CourseMaster.jsx`

**Added**:
- New state: `myEnrollments`
- New function: `fetchMyEnrollments()` calls `/api/courses/my-enrollments`
- Updated `handleEnroll()` to refresh both courses AND enrollments
- New "Continue Learning" section showing enrolled courses with:
  - Progress bars
  - "Continue Learning" buttons
  - Direct access to course content

**Result**: âœ… After enrollment, courses immediately show in "Continue Learning" section

---

### 6. âœ… Course Enrollment 400 Error
**Problem**: Students getting 400 error when trying to enroll

**Analysis**: The error was "You are already enrolled in this course" - backend is working correctly

**Fix**: Updated error handling to show clearer message to user

**Result**: âœ… Users now see clear message if already enrolled instead of generic error

---
