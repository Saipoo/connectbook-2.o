## ‚ùì TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Not Logged In" error
**Solution:**
- Open http://localhost:5173 in the same browser
- Login as Teacher or Admin
- Keep that tab open
- Go back to the HTML file and try again

### Problem: "Already has X courses" message
**Solution:**
- This is GOOD! Courses already exist
- Close the HTML file
- Go straight to testing (Step 2 above)

### Problem: Can't see courses in student view
**Solution:**
1. **Hard refresh** browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Check browser console (Press F12, go to Console tab)
3. Look for errors in red
4. Make sure you're logged in as **Student** (not Teacher)

### Problem: "Generate Certificate" button doesn't appear
**Solution:**
- Make sure you watched **ALL videos** in the course
- Progress must be exactly **100%**
- The course must show status: **"Completed"**
- If stuck at 99%, watch the last video again

### Problem: Certificate shows error
**Solution:**
- Check backend terminal for errors
- Make sure `uploads/courses/certificates/` folder exists
- Try watching all videos again to ensure 100% progress

### ‚úÖ Backend:
- Connected to MongoDB Atlas
- All 25+ API routes working
- Certificate generation service ready
- Auto-completion logic (100% = completed)
- Seed endpoint: `/api/courses/seed-dummy-courses`

### ‚úÖ Frontend:
- Course browsing page
- Course enrollment
- Video player with progress tracking
- Quiz system

## üìÇ FILES YOU CAN DELETE (Optional)

These standalone scripts don't work with MongoDB Atlas:
- ‚ùå `backend/seedCourses.js` (tried to use localhost MongoDB)
- ‚ùå `backend/checkCourses.js` (tried to use localhost MongoDB)
- ‚ùå `backend/setupCourses.js` (tried to use localhost MongoDB)

**Don't worry about them** - they won't interfere with anything!

## üîß TECHNICAL DETAILS

### How Courses are Added:
The HTML file calls this endpoint:
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/courses/seed-dummy-courses
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

### Course Structure:
Each of the 25 courses has:
- Title, Description, Category
- Level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- Estimated Duration (15-80 hours)
- 1-3 sample videos
- All published (visible to students)
- Assigned to your teacher account

### Categories Included:
- Programming (3 courses)

- Mobile Development (3 courses)
- Artificial Intelligence (2 courses)
- Database (2 courses)
- Cloud Computing (2 courses)
- DevOps (3 courses)
- Cybersecurity (2 courses)
- Networking (1 course)
- Other (1 course)

### Certificate Generation:
When student completes a course (100% progress):
1. `enrollment.completed` becomes `true`
2. `enrollment.completionDate` is set
3. "Generate Certificate" button appears (green)
4. Student clicks button
5. Backend generates PDF using PDFKit
6. Saves to `uploads/courses/certificates/`
7. Saves certificate record to database
8. Returns certificate data to frontend
9. Modal shows certificate
10. Student can download PDF
